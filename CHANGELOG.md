### Format:  
[0.6.0] - 2025-10-25
#### Added 
- OpenL3 embedder for audio embedding extraction
- MERT embedder for audio embedding extraction
- `EmbeddersManager` service to manage different embedding models

#### Changed
- Need to downgrade Python to 3.11 due to OpenL3 compatibility issues
- Pair Analysis view to support OpenL3 and MERT embedders for audio embedding extraction
- Embedders are lazy loaded when first requested
- New .env variables for MERT (check in `src/config/env_keys.py`)
- Splitted `BaseEmbedder` into `AudioEmbedder` and `TextEmbedder` abstract classes
- Move audio logic to `audio_utils.py` helper

---
### [0.5.0] - 2025-10-24
#### Added
- View `similarity_ranking_view.py` that creates ranking of audio and text similarity

### Notes
- Tab Text → Audio - user inputs text description, uploads multiple audio files 
and receives a table with ranked similarity and audio previews.
- Tab Audio → Text - user uploads one audio file, inputs multiple text descriptions 
and gets a table with ranked similarity.

#### Added
- TSNE & UMAP reduce dimensions methods in reduce_embeddings_dimensionality function

#### Changed
- PCA plotting function

#### Removed

### [0.3.0] - 2025-10-23
#### Added
- GitHub Actions workflow for Ruff linting and formatting checks on pull requests
- Ruff configuration in `pyproject.toml` with Python 3.13 target and basic linting rules

- Comprehensive development documentation in README with local Ruff usage instructions

#### Changed
- Updated README with development section including code quality guidelines
- Added CI/CD documentation explaining the automated PR workflow

### [0.2.0] - 2025-10-22
#### Added
- BaseEmbedder, ClapEmbedder
- Computations for audio & text inputs
- Basic metrics and visualisations

---

### [0.1.0] - 2025-10-20
#### Added
- Implemented full project structure (`src/`, `app/`, `config/`, `domain/`, `models/`, `ui/`, `utils/`, `assets/`)
- Created functional Streamlit UI with working navigation
- Added views for all major screens (Home, Pair Analysis, Model Comparison, Similarity Ranking, Pseudo-captioning, Local Database)

#### Notes
This version introduces a complete functional skeleton of the application.
No real embedding computations yet. UI and structure ready for integration.
